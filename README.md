# CGI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tbrowder/CGI-Perl6.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tbrowder/CGI-Perl6)

Class methods for the CGI environment; based on Perl 5's CGI module.

The tests use two of the author's servers to provide
CGI responses and hence the standard environment
variables. As long as they are operative, they
should permit good, active testing.

If they provide no response or fail to work as
expected, please contact the author by email
at <tom.browder@gmail.com> and put the
word '[CGI]' in the subject line.

The 'cgi-server' directory has instructions
for setting up one's own CGI test server.
